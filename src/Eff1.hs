-- An example of non-trivial interaction of effects, handling of two
-- effects together
-- Non-determinism with control (cut)
-- For the explanation of cut, see Section 5 of Hinze ICFP 2000 paper.
-- Hinze suggests expressing cut in terms of cutfalse
--  ! = return () `mplus` cutfalse
-- where
--  cutfalse :: m a
-- satisfies the following laws
--   cutfalse >>= k  = cutfalse              (F1)
--   cutfalse | m    = cutfalse              (F2)
-- (note: m `mplus` cutfalse is different from cutfalse `mplus` m)
-- In other words, cutfalse is the left zero of both bind and mplus.
--
-- Hinze also introduces the operation call :: m a -> m a that
-- delimits the effect of cut: call m executes m. If the cut is 
-- invoked in m, it discards only the choices made since m was called.
-- Hinze postulates the axioms of call:
--
--   call false = false                          (C1)
--   call (return a | m) = return a | call m     (C2)
--   call (m | cutfalse) = call m                (C3)
--   call (lift m >>= k) = lift m >>= (call . k) (C4)
--
-- call m behaves like m except any cut inside m has only a local effect,
-- he says.

-- Hinze noted a problem with the `mechanical' derivation of backtracing
-- monad transformer with cut: no axiom specifying the interaction of 
-- call with bind; no way to simplify nested invocations of call.

-- We use exceptions for cutfalse
-- Therefore, the law ``cutfalse >>= k       = cutfalse''
-- is satisfied automatically since all exceptions have the above property.

data CutFalse = CutFalse deriving Typeable

cutfalse = throwError CutFalse

-- The interpreter -- it is like reify . reflect with a twist
-- Compare this implementation with the huge implementation of call
-- in Hinze 2000 (Figure 9)
-- Each clause corresponds to the axiom of call or cutfalse.
-- All axioms are covered.
-- The code clearly expresses the intuition that call watches the choice points
-- of its argument computation. When it encounteres a cutfalse request,
-- it discards the remaining choicepoints.

-- It completely handles CutFalse effects but not non-determinism
