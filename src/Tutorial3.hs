-- Demo of Extensible effects
-- This is the real implementation, but stripped of INLINE pragma and other
-- performace-inducing stuff

-- There are several implementations in Haskell (see Hackages, including
-- packaging of the implementation to be presented). There are at least
-- two implementations in Scala. Extensible effects in PureScript is
-- the defining feature of the language.
-- There is even an implementation of extensible effects in Coq!

The type of inj/prj really shows the union as a (multi)set.

decomp imposes the ordering. Dissatisfaction. What we really need
is something like the local instances with the closure seamntics.
And Haskell almost has what we need! (Implicit parameters).
